This tiny program prints full path of the "root" git directory you're in,
or exits(1) if you're not inside some git repo.

It is intended to be run thousands of times within various scripts,
thus the C version, consuming the least amount of RSS possible.

By the way this is shorter and quicker equivalent of running the following
vanilla git subcommand:

`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
